CORE:
# update status (tray icon) to notify changes, filtered by some level?
# about information?

BUILD/ECOSYSTEM:
# Document modules with Pod::Weaver
# Look at xacobeo sources

GUI:
# remember collapse/expand state
# make "desktop-friendly": install application with icon into user's system menu
# appear window on hot key press as in stardict
# don't show 'mark all as read' when there is nothing to mark
# collapse watchers (rss/filemanager) if there is no events.
# notification level per watcher and default ?
# colorize output?
# sorting: by priority, by config?
# make unified/merged actions column
