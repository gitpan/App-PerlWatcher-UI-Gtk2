CORE:
# update status (tray icon) to notify changes, filtered by some level?
# about information?

BUILD/ECOSYSTEM:
# Integate git plugin to release
# Document modules (with Pod::Weaver?)

GUI:
# appear window on hot key press as in stardict
# don't show 'mark all as read" when there is nothing to mark
# use home directory to store configs : File::Spec->catfile($ENV{'HOME'}, '.ackrc')
# collapse watchers (rss/filemanager) if there is no events.
# notification level per watcher and default ?
# colorize output
# icons by status
# sorting: by priority, by config?
# make unified/merged actions column
